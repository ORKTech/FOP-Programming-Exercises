# 📘 FOP Programming Exercises:
This repository contains programming exercises and laboratory implementations for the Foundations of Programming (FOP) course at MIT World Peace University (MIT-WPU) – Semester 2.
It includes structured practice problems, concept-based implementations, and academic lab work covering core programming fundamentals in C.

---

## 🎯 Objective:
The goal of this repository is to:
Strengthen core programming fundamentals
Improve logical reasoning and structured coding
Maintain a well-organized academic reference for Semester 2

---

## 🎯 Concepts Covered:
- Variables and Data Types
- Arithmetic & Logical Operators
- Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)
- Looping Constructs (for, while, do-while)
- Functions and Modular Programming
- Arrays and Basic Matrix Operations
- Mathematical Computations (Prime, Factorial, GCD, etc.)

---

## 🏫 Course Information:
- Course: Foundations of Programming (FOP)
- University: MIT World Peace University (MIT-WPU)
- Semester: 2
- Specialization: AI & Data Science (AI & DS)
- Language: C
- Development Environment: Visual Studio (or any standard C compiler)

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution Instructions
Each .c file in this repository is independent and can be compiled separately.

---

### 🖥️ 1️⃣ Windows
✅ Option A: 
- Using Microsoft Visual Studio
- Open Visual Studio
- Create a New Console App (C Project)
- Replace the default source file with any .c file from this repository
- Click Build → Build Solution
- Run using Ctrl + F5

✅ Option B: Using MinGW (GCC):
If GCC (MinGW) is installed:

```bash
gcc Armstrong_Number.c -o program
program.exe
```

Replace Armstrong_Number.c with the required filename.

---

### 🐧 2️⃣ Linux (GCC)

Most Linux distributions come with GCC pre-installed.

🔹 Compile:
```bash
gcc Armstrong_Number.c -o program
```

🔹 Run:
```bash
./program
```

If GCC is not installed:
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```
---

### 🍎 3️⃣ macOS (Clang)
macOS uses Clang by default.

🔹 Install Command Line Tools (if not installed):
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

🔹 Compile:
```bash
clang Armstrong_Number.c -o program
```

(You can also use gcc, which maps to Clang on macOS.)

🔹 Run:
```bash
./program
```
